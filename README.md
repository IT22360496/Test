## README: Torrent File Exchange System - C Socket Programming

### Project Overview

This project implements a simplified version of a torrent-like file exchange system using C socket programming. The system consists of:
- A **server program** (`srv0496.c`) that acts as a seeder, capable of handling up to 100 clients simultaneously. It serves files from a shared directory.
- A **client program** (`cli2236.c`) that can download files from or upload files to the server. The client supports resuming interrupted downloads.

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: GCC or any C compiler.
- **Linux/Unix Environment**: The program was designed for a Unix-like environment. It should also run on Windows using tools like Cygwin or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
  
### Source Files

- `srv0496.c`: Server-side program that handles file transfer (upload/download) and serves multiple clients.
- `cli2236.c`: Client-side program for interacting with the server to download or upload files.

### Compilation Instructions

**1. Compile the Server Program:**
```bash
gcc srv0496.c -o server
```

**2. Compile the Client Program:**
```bash
gcc cli2236.c -o client
```

### Running the Programs

#### Server Program Instructions

1. **Create a directory** to hold files that the server will serve to clients. This directory must be named `shared_files` and should contain at least 50 files, each at least 10MB in size.
   ```bash
   mkdir shared_files
   ```
   
2. **Populate the `shared_files/` directory** with files that you want to make available for download.

3. **Start the server** using the following command:
   ```bash
   ./server
   ```

4. The server will start listening for client connections on **IP 127.0.0.1** (localhost) and **port 2236**. It will handle up to 100 clients simultaneously using multi-processing.

#### Client Program Instructions

1. **Run the client program** with the following command:
   ```bash
   ./client <client_ip_address>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   ./client 127.0.0.1
   ```

2. Once connected to the server, you will be prompted to choose between downloading or uploading a file:
   - **Option 1**: Download a file from the server.
   - **Option 2**: Upload a file to the server.

3. If you select to **download**, you will be presented with a list of available files on the server. Choose a file by entering the corresponding number. The client will begin downloading the file, showing progress in percentage.

4. If you select to **upload**, you will be prompted to provide the path to the file you want to upload to the server. The file will be transferred and saved to the serverâ€™s `shared_files/` directory.

#### Error Handling

Both the server and client programs handle common errors, such as:
- Connection issues.
- File-related errors (e.g., file not found, permission denied).
- Incomplete downloads or uploads.

If an error occurs, an appropriate error message will be displayed in the terminal.

### File Logging

- The server logs every client connection and file transfer activity in a log file named `log_srv0496.txt`. The log file contains the client IP address, port number, file requested, and whether the transfer was successful.

### Notes

- The server runs on **port 2236**, and the client binds to **port 1496**.
- The client and server communicate via TCP sockets.
- The client supports **resuming interrupted downloads**. If a file is partially downloaded, it will resume from where it left off.

### Example Interaction

**Server Output:**
```
Server started on IP: 127.0.0.1, Port: 2236
Waiting for client connections...
Client connection from IP 127.0.0.1, Port: 1496
```

**Client Output:**
```
Connecting to server at 127.0.0.1:2236...
Connected to the server.
Choose action: 1 for download, 2 for upload: 1
Available files:
1. file1.txt
2. file2.jpg
3. file3.mp4
Enter the file number to download: 2
Downloading file2.jpg...
Progress: 1%
Progress: 2%
Progress: 100%
Download complete. File saved as file2.jpg
```

### Additional Notes

- Make sure that both the server and client machines are on the same network or adjust the IP address accordingly.
- The project supports downloading and uploading files of any type (text, binary, etc.).

This README file should be sufficient to guide anyone through compiling, running, and interacting with your server and client programs. You can now include this as `README.txt` or `README.md` in your project directory. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
